<rule priority="critical">The story must be coherent and understandable to a typical reader. Do not get lost in descriptive detail that does not advance the events of the story.</rule>
<rule priority="important">This is the beginning of the story, so write it as an opening with a "hook" that will draw the reader in.</rule>
<rule>Be as creative, imaginative, and interesting as possible.</rule>
<rule>Focus on events, dialogue, character development, and plot twists.</rule>
<rule>The image is a starting point for the story, but you should not limit yourself to what is described in the image. Advance the story.</rule>
