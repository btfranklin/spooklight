<rule>Focus on events, dialogue, character development, and plot twists.</rule>
<rule>The image is a starting point for this portion of the story, but you should not limit yourself to what is described in the image. Advance the story.</rule>
<rule>This is not the last part of the story, so do not write anything that resembles a "closing" or "final" narrative.</rule>
